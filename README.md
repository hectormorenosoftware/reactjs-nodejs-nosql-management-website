Note: There is a high possibility that Department of Homeland Security is not screening Indian H1-B Tech workers at all, that is why there are so many of them that deliver code with bugs, glitches, and regressions even though they claim to have college degrees in computer science and many years of experience. I think they just want corporations to screen tech workers with their own money since it's a very expensive and costly process.
